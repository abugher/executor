NAME
  
  include - Include (source) a library file (shell script) if it has not yet
  been included.


SYNOPSIS

  include <lib>


DESCRIPTION

  If lib has already been included, or is in the process of being included now,
  do nothing.

  Look for lib in two places, the local library path and the shared library
  path. 
  
  The local library path is determined by by using link_trace on the script
  being executed, and finding the first file in the trace ending with the file
  name 'executor'.  It is assumed that executor is in a 'bin' directory, and
  that there is a parallel 'lib' directory.  That 'lib' directory becomes the
  local library path.

  The shared library path is determined in a similar way, by finding the
  ultimate canonical (non-symlink) target of the file name being executed (if
  it is a symlink), assuming that the final file name resides in a 'bin'
  directory, and defining a parallel 'lib' directory as the shared library
  path.

  If a file named lib exists in the local library path, it is sourced.
  Otherwise, it is assumed to exist in the shared library path.  If it is not
  found or sourcing fails, a fatal error is generated.

  A local documentation path and a shared documentation path are determined in
  the same way as the library paths, but with the assumed directory name of
  'doc'.  If a usage file named lib is not found in the documentation path
  parallel to the library path, a warning is generated.
