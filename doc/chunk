chunk [-a [-s <output separator>]] <separator> <filter>

  chunk will read stdin into chunks.  separator will be used as a filter for
  grep, and every line matching will be treated as the first line of a chunk.
  Each subsequent line not matching separator will be appended to that chunk,
  until separator is encountered again.

  filter will also be used as a filter for grep.  The first chunk whose first
  line matches filter will be output.  All other chunks will be discarded.

  If -a is specified, all matching chunks will be output.  If -s is also
  specified, output separator will be output before every chunk.

chunk -n <separator>

  As above, but all chunks will be output, sorted by the first lines
  numerically.

chunk -a <separator>

  As above, but sorted alphabetically.
