NAME
  
  link_trace - Output a list of absolute paths in a chain of symlinks.


SYNOPSIS

  link_trace <link>


DESCRIPTION
  
  Output an absolute path to link.  If link is a symlink, redefine link as the
  target of that symlink, and repeat, until link is not a symlink.

  Output is delimited by nulls.  Filenames with newlines, spaces, etc, should be fine.


EXAMPLES

  link_trace ~/bin/chunk | while IFS= read -d $'\0' line; do echo "${line}"; done

    As seen here, link_trace provides consistent output, but the calling script
    must be reader for null delimiters.


BUGS

  Output is delimited by nulls.  It is on purpose and probably necessary if
  link_trace is expected to handle badly named files correctly, but it is
  annoying to work with.
